Welcome,
this is my project of a solver for basic chemical equations.

It was done for Faculty of Mathematics and Physics on Charles University
in Prague, Czech Republic as a programming project in the first semester,
hence Pascal as the language of choice.

The source code can be found in the /source folder.

The documentation pdf , written in Czech, can be found in /documentation.
There also are a few example inputs, with Czech comments in a text file.

Done in Dec 2014 and Jan/Feb 2015.
